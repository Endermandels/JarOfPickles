We've Inc. was a Japanese company that planned and produced anime, published related books, and managed licenses for character products. The head office was located in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo.

The company was founded on August 31, 1988 as Aeon.

It changed its name to We've Inc. in 2002 due to confusion with a major retailer and English conversation school of the same name.

The company was known for producing Viewtiful Joe, Tokyo Mew Mew, Transformers Galaxy Force and many more.

The company merged with FuRyu and dissolved on July 1, 2019.
